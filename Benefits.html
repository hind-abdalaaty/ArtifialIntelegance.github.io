		<h1>Benefits of artificial intelligence:</h1>
		<p>It has five benefits:</p>
		<p>1-time saving:</p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence is characterized by saving a lot of companies and jobs from routines that take a lot of time,</p>
		<p>as it can collect data faster than humans do, which leads to large companies making decisions that rely on information</p>
		<p>faster, to once again overcome artificial intelligence on humans  In a new point.</p>
		<p>2-Eliminate repeat tasks:</p>
		<p>One of the biggest benefits expected of artificial intelligence is that it eliminates the repetition of tasks, which some </p>
		<p>people fall as a result of the increased workloads, where artificial intelligence is characterized by not repeating a single</p>
		<p>work twice due to its containing a more complex software system through scheduling and executing works with a high concentration.</p>
		<p>3-Stay away from the screen:</p>
		<p>You can use artificial intelligence to interact with the information as if it is live data, which makes us do not need to look at</p>
		<p>the computer screen, phone or TV to identify information by simply speaking voice and requesting information, you are answered by</p>
		<p>answering immediately, and that was applied with the Siri system that is similar to the personal assistant in  The business creates</p>
		<p>ticket, alerts, text and other works.</p>
		<p>4-Deeper specialization:</p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence can search more deeply to find out the requirements of individuals and use it in advertising after years of </p>
		<p>launch by preserving the taste of customers and specializing in providing the product that users need in an advertising form to attract</p>
		<p>them, and reaching deeper to the requirements of users through their age groups.</p>
		<p>5-Software with humans, one team:</p>
		<p>With the launch of artificial intelligence significantly, many concepts will be changed. Instead of people using applications and software,</p>
		<p>software and human beings are at one level, each of them performing their tasks separately as a team within any business, and implementing</p> 
		<p>many basic and important tasks without human intervention in them, which leads  Too much business has improved.</p>
