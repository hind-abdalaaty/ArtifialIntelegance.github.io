		<h1>Types of artificial intelligence:</h1>
		<p>Depending on its capabilities, artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types as follows:</p>
		<p>1- Limited or narrow artificial intelligence:</p>
		<p>Weak AI or Narrow AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can perform specific</p>
		<p>and clear tasks, such as self-driving cars, or even speech or image recognition programs, or chess on smart devices  And this type</p>
		<p>of artificial intelligence is the most common and available today.</p>
		<p>2-General Artificial Intelligence:</p>
		<p>is the type that can work with a capacity similar to the human ability in terms of thinking,</p>
		<p>as it focuses on making the machine able to think and plan on its own and in a similar way to human thinking, but there are no</p> 
		<p>practical examples of  This type, for all that exists so far, just research studies need a lot of effort to develop and transform</p>
		<p>it into reality, and the method of artificial neural network: (Artificial Neural Network) is one of the methods of studying general</p>
		<p>artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with the production of a system of neural networks for the machine similar to those </p>
		<p>contained in the body  Human.</p>
		<p>3- Superior Artificial Intelligence:</p>
		<p>Superior Artificial Intelligence is the type that may exceed the level of human intelligence, and which can do the tasks better than</p>
		<p>the specialized and knowledgeable man has, and this type has many characteristics that must be included in it;  As the ability to learn,</p>
		<p>plan, automatic communication and make judgments, the concept of super artificial intelligence is considered a hypothetical concept that</p>
		<p>does not exist in our time.</p>
 
		<h2>Artificial intelligence applications:</h2>
		<p>There are many practical applications of artificial intelligence, and the most prominent of these applications are the following:</p>
		<p>1-Games:</p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence systems are used in many electronic games.  That requires a dimension and strategic thinking, such as poker</p>
		<p>and chess, for exampl.</p>
		<p>2-Intelligent robots:</p>
		<p>Robots do a lot of different actions, as they can do the work that humans do, because of their ability to feel the surrounding factors</p>
		<p>such as light, heat, sound, or movement, through special sensors, and these robots are able to learn from their past experiences and benefit</p>
		<p>Of errors.</p>
		<p>3-Interacting with the spoken voice:</p>
		<p>Some artificial intelligence systems can be used to listen to speech and understand its meanings, even if it is pronounced with some noise</p>
		<p>or pronounced in colloquial or street language.</p>
		<p>4-Interacting with the visual system:</p>
		<p>Some applications of artificial intelligence can interpret and analyze the images entered into them.  Such as facial recognition software,</p>
		<p>image analysis for positioning, and other applications</p>
