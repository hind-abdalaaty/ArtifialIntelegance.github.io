		<p>From the start I say that we need to define intelligence and define what we mean by human intelligence.</p>
		<p>The stage of intelligence applies to any situation seeking to solve complex problems.</p>
		<p>According to the Oxford dictionary definition, intelligence is the ability to understand,</p>
		<p>learn and think.  There are a number of capabilities that could be considered indicators </p>
		<p>of intelligence, namely: learning or understanding from experience, extracting meaning from </p>
		<p>a matter that is likely to mean that extracting a meaning from conflicting or conflicting messages.</p>
		<p>From this definition it can be concluded that if I am on the machine some intelligence then we must</p> 
		<p>have created in it three abilities: understanding, learning, thinking.</p>
		<p>So the new way of trying to simulate human intelligence has created an emergency of new science </p>
		<p>called artificial intelligence.  There are different definitions of artificial intelligence as one of </p>
		<p>its meanings (in the words of John McCarthy who launched it at the Dartmouth Conference) is to make the machine </p>
		<p>behave in a way that can be called intelligence if humans behave the way the machine behaves.  We have found artificial</p>
		<p>intelligence to give the computer the ability to solve problems and make the right decisions in a logical way.</p>
		<p>(1971) he says that the goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that carry out tasks that require </p>
		<p>human intelligence in normal situations.  However, all of these definitions describe one meaning, which is simulating </p>
		<p>human intelligence.  The field of artificial intelligence has opened up new technological applications such as robotics,</p>
		<p>expert systems, games, language processing (NLP) and image and shape recognition.  The subject of artificial intelligence</p>
		<p>has evolved with many sciences.  In addition, innovations related to new </p>
		<p>computer systems inspired by biological sciences clearly indicate that this science is multifaceted knowledge.</p>
		<p>Man has long shown a curiosity in knowing how the human mind works.  Historical records indicate many serious attempts to</p> 
		<p>imitate the level of human intelligence, although some of these attempts did not reach the level of the goals from </p>
		<p>which they were launched.  In fact, the idea of simulating human intelligence has evolved since the emergence of</p> 
		<p>Greek fairy tales in ancient history - this came on the lips of where he said: Hephaesto Big Malin included </p>
		<p>the idea of an intelligent robot.  However, during all these ages, efforts were made to understand the work of the mind,</p>
		<p>and this idea gained in the nineteenth century more scientific credibility when George Polly, the young scientist in </p>
		<p>the field of mathematics, laid the theoretical basis for these symbols, the purpose of which was to present the logic</p> 
		<p>and thinking processes.In the nineteenth century people considered Charles Bay Page (who invented computers) </p>
		<p>that his work was a first step towards inventing machines capable of simulating the capabilities of the human mind in </p>
		<p>the fields of logic and arithmetic.  In 1934, he explained the mechanism of intelligence and made the hypothesis that </p>
		<p>smart behavior came as a result of a loop of information in which the brain collects and processes information and then </p>
		<p>responds to it.  This result encouraged researchers to simulate the human thought method with computers.  The main idea that followed</p>
		<p>was a machine for a person claiming research on an automated programmer system (2006) and emphasized that the importance of this research</p>
		<p>reinforced the concept of establishing an ample and elaborate nature of different types of software.  Also, this idea encouraged </p>
		<p>researchers to develop computers that have reached a degree of digital importance to convert artificial intelligence into a possible reality.</p>
		<p>In the 1950s, Kahlan had developed a calculator and artificial intelligence that answered the question: Can the machine think?</p>
		<p>And his experience turned into an essential foundation for building the smart machine.</p>
