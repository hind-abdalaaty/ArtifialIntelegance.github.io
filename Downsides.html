		<h1>The downsides of artificial intelligence:</h1>
		<p>There are five types of downsides of artificial intelligence:</p>
		<p>1-Unemployment:</p>
		<p>A person cannot match the machine in terms of efficiency, and thus machines will replace humans in various practical fields,</p>
		<p>which increases the unemployment rat.</p>
		<p>2- Data loss: Despite the tremendous memory that such machines may have, there will be no correlation between this information when it is</p> 
		<p>stored and retrieved as humans do, and some damage to the machine can lead to the loss of all data stored on it</p>
		<p>3- There is no place for emotions:</p>
		<p>all human perceptions of conscience, mercy, and collective spirit will disappear, meaning that machines</p>
		<p>can perform many tasks without there being links with humans, and thus artificial intelligence cannot replace human relationships.</p>
		<p>4-High cost:</p>
		<p>Working in this field requires a lot of money both in the machinery manufacturing processes, programming and repair.</p>
		<p>5-Wrong use:</p>
		<p>As many inventions invented by scientists for important purposes, but when they fell into the wrong hands, they were</p>
		<p>exploited for wars, and the exploitation of artificial intelligence for unscientific purposes and not serving society posed a real threat.</p>
