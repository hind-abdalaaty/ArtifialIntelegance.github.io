		<p>When he spoke on this topic about artificial intelligence:</p>
		<p>which is The specific behavior and characteristics of computer programs that make them simulate human mental</p>
		<p>capabilities and working patterns.  Among the most important of these characteristics is the ability to learn,</p>
		<p>infer, and react to situations not programmed in the machine. And artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science.</p>
		<p>Artificial intelligence is defined by many works as "the study and design of smart clients", and a smart customer is </p>
		<p>a system that absorbs its environment and takes situations that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission</p>
		<p>or the mission of its team.</p>
		<p>Also mention the two AI applications:</p>
		<p>1-Games.    2- Intelligent robots.</p>
		<p>3- Interacting with the spoken voice.</p>
		<p>4- Interacting with the visual system.</p>
		<p>And types AI:  </p>
		<p>1- Limited or narrow artificial intelligence.</p> 
		<p>2- General Artificial Intelligence.</p>
		<p>3- Superior Artificial Intelligence.</p>
		<p>Benefits of artificial intelligences:</p>
		<p>1- time saving.</p>
		<p>2 Eliminate repeat tasks.   </p>
		<p>3- Stay away from the screen.</p>
		<p>4 Deeper specialization.   </p>
		<p>5- Software with humans, one team</p>
		<p>And The downsides of artificial intelligence:</p>
		<p>1- Unemployme.  2 Data loss.  </p>
		<p>3 There is no place for emotions.</p>
		<p>4-High Cost. 5-Wrong used.</p>
